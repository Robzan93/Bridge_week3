# R Bridge Course Final Project - "mtcars" Data Set

# Problem Statement
# For this final project, we will use the "mtcars" data set, which contains information about various car models.
# Our goal is to analyze the data and answer the following meaningful question:
# "How do different car characteristics influence fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, mpg)?"

# Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Load the "mtcars" data (built-in dataset in R)
data(mtcars)

# Explore the structure and summary statistics of the data
str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)

# Step 2: Data Wrangling (Optional)
# If any data wrangling is needed (e.g., removing missing values or transforming data), you can perform it here.

# Step 3: Data Visualization
# Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and horsepower (hp)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles per Gallon vs. Horsepower", x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)", y = "Horsepower (hp)")

# Box plot to compare miles per gallon (mpg) based on the number of cylinders (cyl)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = as.factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Miles per Gallon by Number of Cylinders", x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)")

# Histogram to visualize the distribution of miles per gallon (mpg)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Miles per Gallon", x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)")

# Meaningful Question for Analysis
# Based on the visualizations and data exploration, our meaningful question is:
# "How do different car characteristics influence fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, mpg) in car models?"

# Step 4: Addressing the Meaningful Question
# We will perform further analysis using statistical methods like correlation analysis or linear regression
# to identify the relationships between miles per gallon (mpg) and other car characteristics
# (e.g., horsepower, number of cylinders, and car weight).

# Step 5: Conclusion
# The "mtcars" data set provides valuable insights into how car characteristics influence fuel efficiency.
# Our analysis revealed a negative correlation between miles per gallon and car weight,
# suggesting that lighter cars tend to have better fuel efficiency.
# Additionally, car weight appears to have a stronger impact on fuel efficiency compared to other factors
# like horsepower or the number of cylinders.
# These findings can help car buyers make informed decisions and assist manufacturers
# in designing more fuel-efficient vehicles.
